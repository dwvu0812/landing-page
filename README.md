# landing-page
Here project landing page from the Odin project.
Purpose: 
For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content 
onto the page before beginning to style it. 
In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. 
You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, 
but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will end up making things take longer 
and may end up causing you more frustration.
